The purpose of this short paper is to investigate the observability and controllability for Schrödinger equations in the waveguide (semi-periodic) setting.\nOur main result establishes local exact controllability for the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equations (NLS) on three-dimensional waveguide manifold, under certain geometric conditions on the control region. To address the nonlinear control problem, we begin by analyzing the observability properties of the linear Schrödinger operator on a general waveguide manifold. Utilizing H^s estimates of the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM) operator and Bourgain spaces, we then prove local exact controllability through a fixed-point method.","tags":[],"title":"Observability and controllability for Schrödinger equations in the semi-periodic setting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jingrui NIU","Shengquan Xiang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1737652903,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1739558604,"objectID":"66f8ad734a7ae93481eeff66d3c8a5df","permalink":"https://silly-sunshine-7302bf.netlify.app/publication/small-time-control-of-kdv-for-all-critical-lengths/","publishdate":"2025-01-23T18:21:43+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/small-time-control-of-kdv-for-all-critical-lengths/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we consider the small-time local controllability problem for the KdV system on an interval with a Neumann boundary control. In 1997, Rosier discovered that the linearized system is uncontrollable if and only if the length is critical, namely L=2π√(k^2+kl+l^2)/3 for some integers k and l. Coron and Crépeau (2003) proved that the nonlinear system is small-time locally controllable even if the linearized system is not, provided that k=l is the only solution pair. Later, Cerpa and Crépeau showed that the system is large-time locally controllable for all critical lengths. In 2020, Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen found that the system is not small-time locally controllable if 2k+l∉3ℕ. We demonstrate that if the critical length satisfies 2k+l∈3ℕ with k≠l, then the system is not small-time locally controllable. This paper, together with the above results, gives a complete answer to the longstanding open problem on the small-time local controllability of KdV on all critical lengths since the pioneer work by Rosier.","tags":[],"title":"Small-time local controllability of a KdV system for all critical lengths","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Felice Iandoli","Jingrui NIU"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1678987303,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1739559034,"objectID":"c1c9a5eeb7617e667009301dc5a7b56c","permalink":"https://silly-sunshine-7302bf.netlify.app/publication/control-quasilinear-schrodinger-on-tori/","publishdate":"2023-03-16T18:21:43+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/control-quasilinear-schrodinger-on-tori/","section":"publication","summary":"We prove exact controllability for quasi-linear Hamiltonian Schr¨odinger equations on tori of dimension greater or equal then two.

We use microlocal defect measures and the unique continuation property of eigenfunctions to prove that an appropriate observability inequality holds for wave equations with space varying and different speeds coupled by a single control function. For the unique continuation property of eigenfunctions, we construct a counterexample to show that in some metrics, the unique continuation property does not hold.
